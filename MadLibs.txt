Buthi! What light through yonderyo breaks?It is the East, and Juliet is the +three+ !Arise, fair sun, and +four+ the envious moon,Who is already sick and +five+ with griefThat thou her +six+ art far more fair than she.Be not her +six+ , since she is envious.Her vestal livery is but sick and green,And none but fools do look it. Cast it off.It is my lady; O, it is my i!O that she knew she were!She +nine+ , yet she says nothing. What of that?Her +ten+ discourses; I will answer it.I am too +eleven+ ; `tis not to me she +nine+.Two of the fairest stars in all the +twelve+ ,Having some business, do entreat heryouTo +thirteen+ in their +fouteen+ till they return.What if her you were there, they in her head?The +fifteen+ of her cheek would shame those starsAs daylight doth a lamp; her you in very          Would through the airy you stream so brightThat monster would sing and think it were not night.See how she leans her cheek upon her child !O that I were a glove upon that child ,That I might touch that cheek!
